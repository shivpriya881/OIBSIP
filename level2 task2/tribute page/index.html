        Adeline Virginia Woolf ( 25 January 1882 – 28 March 1941) was an English
        writer, considered one of the most important modernist 20th-century
        authors and a pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness as a
        narrative device. Woolf was born into an affluent household in South
        Kensington, London, the seventh child of Julia Prinsep Jackson and
        Leslie Stephen in a blended family of eight which included the modernist
        painter Vanessa Bell. She was home-schooled in English classics and
        Victorian literature from a young age. From 1897 to 1901, she attended
        the Ladies' Department of King's College London, where she studied
        classics and history and came into contact with early reformers of
        women's higher education and the women's rights movement. Encouraged by
        her father, Woolf began writing professionally in 1900. After her
        father's death in 1904, the Stephen family moved from Kensington to the
        more bohemian Bloomsbury, where, in conjunction with the brothers'
        intellectual friends, they formed the artistic and literary Bloomsbury
        Group. In 1912, she married Leonard Woolf, and in 1917, the couple
        founded the Hogarth Press, which published much of her work. They rented
        a home in Sussex and moved there permanently in 1940. Woolf had romantic
        relationships with women, including Vita Sackville-West, who also
        published her books through Hogarth Press. Both women's literature
        became inspired by their relationship, which lasted until Woolf's
        death.[3] During the inter-war period, Woolf was an important part of
        London's literary and artistic society. In 1915, she had published her
        first novel, The Voyage Out, through her half-brother's publishing
        house, Gerald Duckworth and Company. Her best-known works include the
        novels Mrs Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927) and Orlando (1928).
        She is also known for her essays, including A Room of One's Own (1929).
        Woolf became one of the central subjects of the 1970s movement of
        feminist criticism and her works have since attracted much attention and
        widespread commentary for "inspiring feminism". Her works have been
        translated into more than 50 languages. A large body of literature is
        dedicated to her life and work, and she has been the subject of plays,
        novels and films. Woolf is commemorated today by statues, societies
        dedicated to her work and a building at the University of London.
        Throughout her life, Woolf was troubled by mental illness. She was
        institutionalised several times and attempted suicide at least twice.
        According to Dalsimer (2004) her illness was characterized by symptoms
        that today would be diagnosed as bipolar disorder, for which there was
        no effective intervention during her lifetime. In 1941, at age 59, Woolf
        died by drowning herself in the River Ouse at Lewes.

       <hr> “I went from one to the other holding my sorrow - no, not my sorrow but
        the incomprehensible nature of this our life - for their inspection.
        Some people go to priests; others to poetry; I to my friends, I to my
        own heart, I to seek among phrases and fragments something unbroken - I
        to whom there is no beauty enough in moon or tree; to whom the touch of
        one person with another is all, yet who cannot grasp even that, who am
        so imperfect, so weak, so unspeakably lonely.”</hr> 

       <hr> “How far do our feelings take their colour from the dive underground? I
        mean, what is the reality of any feeling?”</hr>
